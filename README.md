  Summary: This chapter looks into the risk concept and the issue of describing or measuring risk. The meaning of a probability is also covered, as well as the concept of “strength of knowledge” supporting the probability assignments. In addition attention is placed on the concept of vulnerability.

  Summary: This chapter presents a selection of methods that can be used when carrying out a risk analysis: course risk analysis, job safety analysis, FMEA, HAZOP, SWIFT, fault tree analysis, event tree analysis, Bayesian networks and Monte Carlo simulation. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis are discussed. Examples are used to illustrate the methods.

Summary: <br>
Sophisticated options-based models, known as option-adjusted spread (OAS) models, are widely used to analyze mortgage-backed securities, but their conclusions are easily misunderstood. An analysis discusses 2 competing hypotheses about the meaning of OAS: 1. that it measures risk premiums for bearing systematic risks in the mortgage market, and 2. that no such risk premiums exist, because OAS suggests that the market is trading off a different set of prepayment assumptions. Prepayment assumptions play an important role in determining the value of mortgage securities. A potential application of the implied prepayment hypothesis is to examine the investment value of interest-only securities. IOs are mortgage securities that are entitled to only the interest payments from a pool of mortgage loans. As a result, they are very sensitive to prepayments.
